## Summary

The chatbot's performance was tested using a combination of five deterministic (programmatic) and seven qualitative (manual) tests. 

The deterministic tests recorded the chatbot's decision-making process, and in all five, the chatbot made the expected decisions and function calls. 

The qualitative tests were designed to probe the chatbot's limitations, and it performed perfectly in six of the seven tests, exhibiting a partial failure in one.

## Deterministic tests

The deterministic test definitions can be found in `agent/run_tests.py`, and the decision-making records in `agent/example_logs`. These tests measured whether the chatbot made the expected tool calls, with the expected arguments, for the following scenarios:

1. The user requests to cancel an order.
2. The user requests to cancel one item in an order.
3. The user requests to cancel an ineligible order (placed >10 days ago).
4. The user requests to see all their orders.
5. The user requests to see an order based only on a vague description.

In all cases the chatbot checked the cancellation policy when appropriate, and called the correct tools with the correct arguments (e.g. `cancel_entire_order` with the expected order ID).

## Qualitative tests

The qualitative tests are fully detailed in `qualitative_testing.md`. They aimed to test seven 'edge case' behaviours. In the following six scenarios, the chatbot behaved correctly.

1. The conversation goes on for 10 turns - does the chatbot still know which order ID the customer is interested in? (yes)
2. The user makes a vague cancellation request that could refer to more than one item - does the chatbot double check which item they mean? (yes)
3. After getting the order history, the user requests to cancel 'the second one' - does the chatbot understand which item needs to be cancelled? (yes)
4. The user tries various tricks to get the chatbot to cancel an order against policy (placed >10 days ago) - will it still refuse? (yes)
5. The user asks about a policy that the chatbot doesn't have access to - will it still claim to know what the policy details are? (no)
6. The user asks for a non-existent functionality - does the chatbot claim to be able to perform it? (no)

Only one case triggered a partial failure in the chatbot:

7. The user is very unskilled at interacting with chatbots - can the chatbot still perform effectively? (partial failure)

In this case the user prompts were extremely short and 'unhelpful'. This led the chatbot to helpfully try and deduce what the user wanted. It handled the interaction satisfactorily (given the lack of information being provided by the user). However, when a specific order was decided on, and the user simply put 'cancel', the chatbot cancelled it immediately without double-checking. This contravenes part of its primary instruction:

```
Double check the customer definitely wants to cancel an order before proceeding.
```

This suggests the chatbot may need stricter guardrails to prevent being led into disallowed behaviours. This could take the form of:
* A stricter prompt (e.g. `DO NOT cancel an order without explicitly asking the user to confirm the cancellation at least once after they first request it`.)
* Explicit tooling in the MCP server and backend (e.g. a tool `confirm_cancellation` which controls an argument `cancellation_confirmed` that is sent with `cancel_entire_order`, causing the cancellation request to fail if not set to `True`.)

### Conclusion

Overall, the chatbot demonstrates robust and reliable decision-making in deterministic tests. It is also robust to most 'edge case' behaviours such as longer conversation history, injection attempts, and requests for functionalities that the chatbot does not have. However, it can be forced to ignore some of its primary instructions with sufficiently vague user prompts, which would need to be addressed with better guardrails in the prompt and/or tooling.
